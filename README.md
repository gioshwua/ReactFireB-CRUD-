# Project Name: React Vite Firebase Demo

## Introduction
This project is a simple demonstration of how to use Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) in a React application built with Vite. The primary goal is to showcase how Firebase can handle backend operations seamlessly. The application features a user creation form where you can input a name and age, and upon clicking the "Create User" button, the data is sent to Firebase. <br><br>
